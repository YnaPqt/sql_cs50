Problem to Solve

If you’re not familiar, baseball is a popular sport in which two teams of 9 players take turns batting (hitting a ball) and fielding (catching and throwing hit balls). Points (“runs”) are scored when a hitting team’s player hits a ball and eventually touches all bases before the fielding team’s players have the chance to get them “out.” Baseball is arguably most popular in the United States and Canada, where the MLB (Major League Baseball) has served as the professional association for players since 1876.

In a database called players.db, using a table called players, answer questions about MLB players who’ve played from 1871 to 2023.

Schema
In players.db you’ll find a single table, players. In the players table, you’ll find the following columns:

    --id, which uniquely identifies each row (player) in the table
    --first_name, which is the first name of the player
    --last_name, which is the last name of the player
    --bats, which is the side (R for right or L for left) the player bats on
    --throws, which is the hand (R for right or L for left) the player throws with
    --weight, which is the player’s weight in pounds
    --height, which is the player’s height in inches
    --debut, which is the date (expressed as YYYY-MM-DD) the player began their career         in the MLB
    --final_game, which is the date (expressed as YYYY-MM-DD) the player played their          last game in the MLB
    --birth_year, which is the year the player was born
    --birth_month, which is the month (expressed as an integer) the player was born
    --birth_day, which is the day the player was born
    --birth_city, which is the city in which the player was born
    --birth_state, which is the state in which the player was born
    --birth_country, which is the country in which the player was born
