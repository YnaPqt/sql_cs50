Normals
    On the heels of a new annual heat record set in 2022 — the latest in a string of record-setting years — average ocean surface temperatures around the globe have spiked since early March. Excluding polar regions, they are about two-tenths of a degree Celsius warmer than scientists have ever observed at this time of year via satellite data.

Problem to Solve

How do we know whether ocean temperatures are lower or higher than “normal”? What’s a “normal” temperature? Turns out that scientists have developed a metric called a “Climate Normal.” A Climate Normal characterizes aspects of earth’s climate—its long-term weather—over a span of 30 years. One important metric is ocean temperature.

In a database called normals.db, using a table called normals, explore some of the most recent Climate Normal data to understand what makes a normal ocean temperature around the world.

Schema
The data in normals.db can be visualized as shown:

Notice that the earth is divided into a grid of coordinates—points that can identify most any location on earth. Each coordinate is a combination of latitude and longitude. And notice how each coordinate over an ocean has some normal ocean surface temperature associated with it!

In normals.db you’ll find a single table of coordinates, normals. In the normals table, you’ll find the following columns:

    --id, which uniquely identifies each row (coordinate) in the table
    --latitude, which is the degree of latitude (expressed in decimal format) for the coordinate
    --longitude, which is the degree of longitude (expressed in decimal format) for the coordinate
    --0m, which is the normal ocean surface temperature (i.e., the normal temperature at 0 meters of depth), in degrees Celsius, at the coordinate
    --5m, which is the normal ocean temperature at 5 meters of depth, in degrees Celsius, at the coordinate
    --10m, which is the normal ocean temperature at 10 meters of depth, in degrees Celsius, at the coordinate

And observations continue until 5500m, or 5500 meters of depth, for some coordinates!

Since normals is a wide table, if you want to preview the contents, consider SELECTing only the latitude, longitude, and a few depth columns.

Specification
For each of the following questions, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular observations: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular observation were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question.
