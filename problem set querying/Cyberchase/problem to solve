Problem to Solve

Welcome to Cyberspace! Cyberchase is an animated, educational kid’s television series, aired by the United States’ Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) since 2002. Originally designed to “show kids that math is everywhere and everyone can be good at it,” the world of Cyberchase centers on Jackie, Matt, and Inez as they team up with Digit—a “cybird”—to stop Hacker from taking over Cyberspace and infecting Motherboard. Along the way, the quartet learn math, science, and problem-solving skills to thwart Hacker in his attempts.

In a database called cyberchase.db, using a table called episodes, chase answers to PBS’s questions about Cyberchase’s episodes thus far.


Schema

Each database has some “schema”—the tables and columns into which the data is organized. In cyberchase.db you’ll find a single table, episodes. In the episodes table, you’ll find the following columns:

    id, which uniquely identifies each row (episode) in the table
    season, which is the season number in which the episode aired
    episode_in_season, which is the episode’s number within its given season
    title, which is the episode’s title
    topic, which identifies the ideas the episode aimed to teach
    air_date, which is the date (expressed as YYYY-MM-DD) on which the episode “aired” (i.e., was published)
    production_code, which is the unique ID used by PBS to refer to each episode internally

Specification

For each of the following questions, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular episodes: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular episode were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of episodes, for example, then your query should not also output each episodes’s air date.
